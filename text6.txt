Thereâ€™s always a risk to lose or compromise medical records stored in clinics' databases. Blockchain has the potential to challenge the status quo. Using a public-private key, a patient can decide who is going to have access to their record. If a specialist is needed for a consultation, a patient can grant access via a system that all parties are using.
